# SolidFire AIQ access via python
  scripts for accessing SolidFire AIQ via selenium for data processing

# Installation
  Minimum Python 3.6 for printf printing
	Selenium for browser automation as AIQ does not offer CLI based login.
		python pip install -m install -U selenium
	PrettyTable is also in use for some scripts.
		python pip install -m install -U prettytable
	Requests for REST access (I will try to look into using urllib to avoid this dependency, but have no ETA on removing requests.)
		python pip install -m install requests
  Support "modules" are run from the modules directory, be sure it is in the root with the functional scripts

#Usage
  Use the readme.txt file for each scripts sample usage and output
